								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Purple.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Mortal Controller of Purple is the first member of the Three Mortal Controllers. He is often the most powerful. The Mortal Controller of Purple can manipulate matter and energy to his own will and his color is, obviously, purple. His raw power value is 10,248,176. His relative power value is 10,564,350.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Death.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Mortal Controller of Death is the second member of the Three Mortal Controllers. Oftentimes the Mortal Controller of Death is a female human rather than a male one, unlike the other two members. The Mortal Controller of Death has control over life and death and her color is blue. Her raw power value is 10,100,192. Her relative power value is 10,564,350.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Time.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Mortal Controller of Time is the final member of the Three Mortal Controllers. He usually has the most raw power, as Time is an unwieldy power. The Mortal Controller of Time has control over time and his color is yellow. His raw power value is 10,601,110. His relative power level is 10,564,350.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Purple_Star.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>All three of the Mortal Controllers were chosen by the Immortal Form, whose raw and relative power is ∞. Unfortunatly, the Immortal Form can't fight in mortal battles.</p>

						<!-- Enemies -->
							<article id="enemies">
								<h2 class="major">Enemies</h2>	
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Orange.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The three mortal controllers' main enemy is Kaleb. Kaleb is the most powerful and the most evil being in the solar system. He is the ruler of the Orange Empire and has built up quite a substantial army of Orangemen. He also has several trusted warriors. His raw power value is 20,108,296, but his relative power value is 18,799,480 due to the color density of orange, which is the second lowest of any color.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Skeletons.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>His first evil minions are the Spooky Scary Skeletons, whose name doesn't inspire fear in anyone except for little children. Each of their four members has a specific title.</p>
								<p>The first skeleton's title is the Skeleton of Death, who doesn't have the same degree of control over death as the Mortal Controller of Death. This skeleton is the oldest and most evil of the skeletons. It's raw power value is 6,912,918, but it's relative power value is 6,481,750.</p>
								<p>The second skeleton's title is the Skeleton of Music. He can use soundwaves to destroy his enemies. This skeleton is the kindest of the four skeletons, but it's still very cruel to it's enemies. It's raw power value is 6,117,192, but it's relative power value is 6,481,750.</p>
								<p>The third skeleton's title is the Skeleton of Destructive Tendencies. He can manipulate people's emotions and, to a lesser extent, their thoughts. This skeleton prefers instantly killing his opponents, generally by forcing them to commit suicide. It's raw power value is 12,918,182, but it's relative power value is 6,481,750.</p>
								<p>The fourth and final skeleton's title is the Skeleton of Defensive Structures. It can create magical orange structures at will. These structures are indestructable, but immobile. This skeleton is the strategist of the group, which is a despised title in the Skeleton Societies. It's raw and relative power value is 6,481,750.</p>

						<!-- Allies -->
							<article id="allies">
								<h2 class="major">Allies</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Mortal Controllers have several important allies, all of whom are listed here.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Kirby.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Their first ally is Kirby the Pink Puffball, whose color is pink. He can harness the energy of any being that is less powerful than he is and use that energy as his own for 1 minute. Once this duration ends, any leftover energy is returned to his victim. His raw power value is 10,000,000, but his relative power value is 8,000,800.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Green_Alien.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Their second ally is a cliché green alien who is actually the result of the Mortal Controller of Purple's Project-Green-Alien, which means that he is the Mortal Controller of Purple's creation. He can fire energy blasts out of his hands, and he has eye lasers. His raw power value is 8,918,280, but his relative power value is 8,760,240.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Green_Pasta.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Bobby is the Mortal Controllers' childhood friend from the moment they met. He likes to eat green pasta and his color happens to be green. He can fire green energy blasts at his enemies, and he can turn into a cloud. Unlike the other allies, Bobby has a battle cry, which is "Beethoven Day!" This battle cry doesn't inspire fear in anyone but small children because he yells almost as loud as an XF-84H Thunderscreech taking off. Bobby is also Kaleb's son, so he is the most unpredictable of any ally. His raw and relative power value is exactly 8,000,000.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Elements.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Controller of Elements has control over all elements. He doesn't have a color because the elements don't have a collective color. His favorite ability is the Electro Disc, which is a disc made of purple electricity. His raw power value is 9,012,290, and his relative power value is 9,640,070.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Lord_Lunceford.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>Lord Lunceford is the ruler of Luncefordia and his color is blue. He can fire blue energy blasts at his enemies. He also goes by the name Jerry. His other title is The Master of Blue. His raw power value is 11,111,110, but his relative power value is 9,102,930.</p>

								<h2>Items</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Purple_Sword_2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Sword of Purple Darkness is a special sword that can convert all of the light within 1 cube kilometer into Purple Darkness. It is used by the Mortal Controller of Purple and increases his relative power value by 500,000.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Orange_Sword.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Sword of Orange is a powerful sword wielded by Kaleb himself. It is indestructable, and can convert anyone into a being of Orange. This sword increases Kaleb's relative power value by 500,000.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/Blue_Sword.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								<p>This ancient artifact was forged by the Blumen thousands of years ago for Lord Lunceford. He still has it to this day. It causes the user's color density to increase by 20%. This sword increases Lord Lunceford's relative power value by 450,000.</p>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/The_Catalyst.png" alt="" /></span>
								<p>The Catalyst is a device capable of destroying an entire solar system. It's current whereabouts are unknown.</p>
